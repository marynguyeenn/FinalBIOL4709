#'@title Transforming rRNA/ITS sequencing data to a similar, standard format
#'@description
#'This function takes the an input of sequenced rRNA/ITS data and changes its structure from wide, to long. It also categorizes the information by the phylum taxonomy, and adds a column to indicate the year that the data samples were taken.

#'@param df The name of the specified data set
#'@param year The year the that the data set was collected
